# Project: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
## Overview

This project focuses on implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for unsupervised representation learning. GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data resembling real data, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and synthetic data. The Fashion MNIST dataset is used for image generation, where the generator learns to produce images of clothing items.

### Key Components

    GANs: Implementation of GAN architecture for image generation.

    Fashion MNIST Dataset: Description and utilization of the benchmark dataset.

    Discriminator and Generator: Code snippets for implementing discriminator and generator networks.

# Project: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
## Overview

This project explores the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating high-quality images. Specifically, chest X-ray images from a dataset downloaded from Kaggle are used. The VAE is implemented using PyTorch, and training involves encoding input images into a lower-dimensional latent space and decoding them back. Evaluation metrics such as Inception score and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) are used to assess the quality of generated images.
### Key Components

    Methodology: Overview of data preparation, encoder-decoder architecture, model creation, loss function, and optimizer.

    Results: Visualization of training loss, generated images, and model evaluation metrics.

    Code Snippets: Code snippets for key components such as encoder, hyperparameters, data loading, and evaluation.
